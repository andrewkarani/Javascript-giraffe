<!--    I WANT TO BE ABLE TO CLICK THIS BUTTON AND THEN 5 SECONDS LATER I WANT AN ALERT MESSAGE TO POP UP
WE CUD USE JS TIMING
the 1st thing is to attach an event handler on to this button. inside of the quotation marks we put what we want to happen wen clicked
we can call a special JS timing function called setTimeout.
it allows us to set a timer and we can specify how longwe want that timer to be 
and wen the timer runs out it will executea JS function
inside the settimout we set 2 parameters. 
1st one is the name of the function I want to execute at the end of the time interval
2nd parameter is the duration. the time is set to milliseconds
rem you have to create the function inside your JS file-->
  <button onClick="setTimeout(sayHi, 3000)">Click Me</button>
  <button onClick="setInterval(funcName, 3000)">Click Me</button> <!-- allows you to execute a function at specific intervals . it happens infinitely-->

  <script src="timing.js"></script>
